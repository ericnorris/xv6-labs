# xv6-labs

Implementation of https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/.

## Reproducing this repository

```sh
# add the class git server as a remote, from https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.1810/2023/labs/util.html
git remote add xv6-labs-2023-upstream git://g.csail.mit.edu/xv6-labs-2023

# fetch all branches from the labs, but prefix them with xv6-labs-2023/*
# h/t https://stackoverflow.com/a/56030832
git fetch xv6-labs-2023-upstream refs/heads/*:refs/heads/xv6-labs-2023/*

# start from the `riscv` branch
git checkout -b main xv6-labs-2023/riscv

# push all of the branches, including the prefixed lab branches, to github
git push --all origin
```

## Developing

```sh
nix-shell
```

## Implementing a lab

First, merge `main` into the $LAB branch so you can utilize nix-shell:

```sh
git checkout xv6-labs-2023/$LAB
git merge main
```

Then, once you've implemented the lab, merge it back into main:

```sh
git checkout main
git merge xv6-labs-2023/$LAB
```
